# 👋 Hi, I'm Mark Andro

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Software Architecture student** at ITS Angelo Rizzoli with a passion for both **coding** and **art**—especially drawing manga panels of my favorite characters and moments.

I'm on a journey to **merge web development and visual storytelling**. As a beginner, I'm constantly learning, and once something clicks with me, I go all in—coding gives me endless room to explore, and that's why I love it.

Outside of tech, I'm an avid **runner** (I've completed several half-marathons 🏃‍♂️) and a big fan of **reading**.  
I also have a competitive side—previously ranked in the **top 1%** of European servers in **MOBA games** like *League of Legends* and *Wild Rift*, which led me to join the **QLASH Academy** (Italian national esports team).

## 🎨 Fun Fact

I'm a routine guy—but sometimes I get into these insane flow states where I can work all night on something I'm passionate about.  
**Blessing or curse?** Still figuring that out 😄
